# CFBooter
Leaked Project file of Timothy (discord: fel enjoyer#2654) and Buffer (some other mortally loose NPC), One of many project's our friendly Swedish has created

CFBooter is a highly skidded, and poorly coded; slowloris based attack.


### Example command line
java -jar CFBooter.jar example.domain 30 GET DC http 80 false none

- Can do Get and POST requests


### Due to the poorly coded booter, Array lists and other certain bits of data is hard coded such as the proxies being attempted to use, which also because of basic common sense, expire...
Example where it view: private static String[] proxy = {

Original README
Simple Java booter, meant to be used with Mavy.
